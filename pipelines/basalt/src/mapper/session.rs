//! Stateful offline mapper ingestion at Basalt's `NfrMapper::addMargData`
//! boundary.
//!
//! The lower-level mapper functions intentionally operate on one
//! [`MargData`] packet at a time.  Upstream
//! `NfrMapper` does not, however: it reduces and factor-recovers each packet,
//! then retains the valid frame poses, recovered factors, and raw images in a
//! long-lived mapper object.  Keeping that boundary explicit prevents a
//! caller from accidentally optimizing only the last packet or dropping the
//! image records needed by the later feature stages.
//!
//! This module is independent of the estimator's AOM construction and IMU
//! factor implementation.  It consumes the versioned `MargData` contract
//! produced by those components and mirrors only the pinned upstream mapper
//! ingestion order.
//!
//! The pinned C++ mapper keys its aligned pose/image maps by camera timestamp.
//! The Rust MargData contract carries a compact `frame_id` alongside that
//! timestamp, so this stateful adapter keeps poses keyed by frame ID and
//! retains `frame_timestamps` for trajectory/result serialization.  Image
//! buckets remain timestamp-keyed, with their records translated back to the
//! frame-ID graph identity at detection/stereo boundaries.
